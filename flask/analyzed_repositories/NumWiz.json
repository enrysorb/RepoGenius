    "Testing/hand_resnet18_our.py": "Here are the answers:\n\n**1. Brief description:**\nThis code uses OpenCV to capture webcam video, detects hand gestures using MediaPipe, and classifies the detected hands into five classes using a pre-trained ResNet-18 deep learning model.\n\n**2. Code evaluation:**\nI give this code an 8 out of 10. The code is well-organized, and the comments are brief but informative. However, some of the variable names (e.g., `mp_hands`, `hands`) could be more descriptive, and there are no docstrings.\n\n**3. Code analysis:**\na. Number of lines of code: 34\nb. Number of loops: 1 (while loop)\nc. Number of if statements: 1 (not ret condition)\nd. Number of functions/methods: 1 (the code does not contain any standalone functions or methods)\ne. Line numbers of constructs:\n   - Loop: 19 (while loop)\n   - If statement: 17 (not ret condition)\n   - Function/method: None\n\n**4. Code improvement and refactoring:**\na. Code improvement:\n   - Consider adding docstrings to explain the purpose of the code and the variables.\n   - Use more descriptive variable names, such as `webcamCapture` instead of `cap`.\n   - Consider using a more efficient way to normalize the image, such as using `torchvision.transforms.Normalize` directly on the tensor instead of converting to PIL and back.\n\nb.
