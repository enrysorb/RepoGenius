    "createDataset.py": "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\n**1. Brief description:**\nThe code is a Python script that uses the MediaPipe Hand solution to detect hands in images, crops the detected hands to a specified size with a margin, and saves the cropped images to a new directory. The script also collects hand landmarks data and labels, storing them in separate lists.\n\n**2. Code evaluation:**\nI'd rate the code an 8 out of 10. The code is generally easy to follow, and the use of constants at the beginning (e.g., `hand_directory`, `output_directory`) is a good practice. However, some parts could be improved for clarity and efficiency.\n\n**3. Code analysis:**\na. Number of lines of code: 44\n\nb. Number of loops: 0\n\nc. Number of if statements: 2\n\nd.

Code improvement and refactoring:**\n\na. Code improvement:\n* Consider adding a docstring to the `crop_and_resize_hand` function to describe its purpose and parameters.\n* Instead of using `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum coordinates of the hand landmarks, you could use list comprehensions for better performance.\n* The script assumes that the hand landmarks are always provided, but you might want to add error handling in case this is not the case.\n* Consider using a more descriptive variable name instead of `image` for the input image.\n\nb. Original code:\n```python\ndef crop_and_resize_hand(image, hand_landmarks, margin=20, size=400):\n    ...\n```\nc.

Additionally, I've added a docstring to describe the function's purpose and parameters.",
