Refactored code:\n```java\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\nclass CallComparator implements Comparator<Call> {\n\n    /**\n     * Sorts calls based on passage and floor number\n     */\n    @Override\n    public int compare(Call x, Call y) {\n\n        if (handleSpecialCalls(x, y)) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        if (x.getPassage() == y.getPassage()) {\n            return comparePassageAndFloor(x, y);\n        }\n\n        return x.getPassage() < y.getPassage() ? -1 : 1;\n    }\n\n    private boolean handleSpecialCalls(Call x, Call y) {\n        return x.isSpecialCall() || y.isSpecialCall();\n    }\n\n    private int comparePassageAndFloor(Call x, Call y) {\n        if (x.getPassage() == 1 || x.getPassage() == 2) {\n            return x.getFloor().compareTo(y.getFloor());\n        }\n        return -1;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis refactored code introduces two new methods: `handleSpecialCalls` and `comparePassageAndFloor`. The `compare` method is simplified by calling these new methods and returning the result. The logic for handling up-peak calls is extracted into a separate method, making the code easier to read and maintain.",
